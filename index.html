        <h1> More About Me...</h1>
        Hello, Welcome to my ePortfolio. I created this site as a part of my assignment in COMP 2511 - Web Development.
        <hr />
        <p>
            My name is Abivansh Arva, I am a second year Bachelor of Computer Info System at Mount Royal University in
            Calgary, Alberta.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am passionate about problem-solving and finding creative solutions to challenges. When Iâ€™m not occupied
            in coding, assignments and projects, you will find me working on cars or construction. Although, I like
            coding, I also have a passion for hands-on jobs. My unique combination of technical skills along with
            academic
            skills drives me to approach challenges with a mindset to learn and solve an issue creatively.

        <h2>Projects that are interesting in COMP 2511</h2>


        <h4>Assignment 1 & 2</h4>
        <P>
            One of the biggest coding project that I have taken up has to be the Assignment 1 and 2 in COMP 2511. Bir
            (Partner) and I have designed a car website from my inspiration from cars. The website included three pages
            with three cars and more of the content on the website was generated from ChatGPT.
        </P>
        <p>
            Although, generating the content was fairly easy and sketching was fairly easy, the HTML5 and CSS part was
            much more difficult. With minimum knowledge about CSS, it was super complicated to position the images
            around the website so they stay relative to other things in the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some other challanges came in during assignment 2 where I was suppose to make the existing website
            responsive. Except for the content, none of the code was close to salvageble. We had to start the whole
            project again but using grids and media quries to make it mroe responsive.
        </p>
        <p>Reflection: While doing the responsive part of the website, I have realized that it is not easy to make a
            website responsive. From here on out, I am planning on using grid and relative fonts to design websites.
            Using grids, it will be much easier to make a webiste responsive without much more work.</p>

        <h4>Java - Truck Sim</h4>
        <p>
            One of the most interesting projects that I have taken up was a truck simulator for my Gr 11 Java class. I
            had the freedom to build any game I would like and it didnt have to have any graphics. Although, I wanted to
            make it graphicial I reliazed that I did not have the skills to do that.
        </p>
        <p>
            The truck sim came along really well except for the fact that I could not add all the features that I wanted
            to. The main goal of the truck sim was the user owns a logistics company that they have to build into an
            empire. The game included choices for the materials the user wanted to transport and how they would like to
            transport. The user had the choice to do it the right way but they could also speed which could potentailly
            get them speeding tickets.
        </p>
        <p>
            The one thing I learned from that project is how critical time management was. I did not have the best plan
            for the tackle the things I wanted. The time constraints did not allow me to add some features.
        </p>

        <h4>Chem 1201 - The Concept of CLEAR assignments</h4>
        <a href="Clear No.4.docx.pdf" target="_blank"><img class="clearimg" src="image/Clear No.4.docx-1.png"></a>
        <p>
            One most useful skills and assignments that I have learned since the start of university is the concept of
            Clear Assignments. In Chem 1201 Labs, we were suppose to write a clear assignment that would take a concept
            that we learned in the lab and connect to our real life.
        </p>
        <p>
            This has been a great way for me to remember a lot of theoritical stuff with school. Applying and connecting
            the concept to something that we learned in class meant that I fully understood the assingmnent.

        <h4>In-depth review of the ePortfolio</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Proximity: The elements such as the images and pdf previews are perceived a group.</li>
            <li> Similarity: The similar color and shapes like the artifacts depict the elements belongs together as in
                they are all explaining the same thing.</li>
            <li> Figure-Ground: The reason I choose the white over the blue background was to make it easier to read. I
                used a software to calculate a contrast ratio of 4.0 or higher to achieve readability.</li>
            <li> Symmetry and Order: Ordered layout such as the artifacts are perceived as more balanced and
                aesthetically. This principle improves the visual appeal of interfaces.</li>

        Fun Fact about Me:
    </h2>
    <p>
        I often find my-self finding solutions to academic problems when I am working on cars or when I build
        something.
